This section will provide the links to the supplies needed and my recommendations of YouTube tutorials. It is important to note that you should explore Youtube for tutorials and a channel that you can stay consistent with making sure their style of teaching would work for you. I also suggest that you maybe find someone else that knows how to crochet that can help you. The key thing about learning how to crochet your stitches is not going to be perfect but understand it’s a journey, a process that you must have patience with. Next thing you know your projects will slowly improve as your skills increase.       </p>

      <p>
        Getting into crochet is a low cost hobby since it only requires a hook & yarn. You can purchase them from your local craft store (Micheals & Joann) or even a starter kit from amazon. The total should be no more than $20 to begin with. It's more of a time commitment hobby that requires patience and trail/error. Youtube is full of great beginner tutorials on the basic stitches and great patterns to follow along.

       The link above are just the crochet hooks from amazon costing $10. These hooks are a great and I recommend for beginners. All you would have to do is buy yarn seperate I suggest buying it from your local craft since it's cheaper than the yarn on amazon. I have also included an link that is an complete kit that includes everything you need to crochet with and extra things costing $20.

This exact channel and youtube tutorials are the first videos I watched and follow along when learning the basic stitches.       </p>
        <a href="https://youtu.be/GALGQdP_POw">Granny Square Tutorial</a>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/4TxLDNzSd3Q">Granny Sqaure Tote Tutorial</a>
  <p>
    
        </p>After learning the basic stitches I wouldn't suggest going straight into a big project. Instead start small by first learning how to make an granny sqaure with the first link above. Then you can create as many sqaures as you would need to sew them together to create a bag with the follow tutorial.
