        My Crochet Journey:
      </h2>
      <p>
I self taught myself how to crochet with Youtube tutorials in middle school with support from lunch aids. I had found a hobby that was a true pastime that would be able to fill up the long hours my mom would work. I would be home with my ipad, yarn and my hook with no limit to my creativity and passion. I had lost touch with crocheting getting side tracked with highschool. It wasn't until when lockdown happened during my sophomore year I picked up the hook again and never put it down. Realizing the true potential of crocheting and it became a coping mechanism and love language. I wanted to share this passion with my peers and was able to form an online crochet club. I helped them learn the basic stitches and my close friends were inspired to learn and I guided them as well. 
My love of crochet has evolved alongside me and my different chapters in life because of this impact for my college essay I chose the topic of my relationship with crocheting. I have included my college essay if you wish to read it! This piece of writing is a love letter to crochet expressing gratitude which I’m proud of. As for my next steps, I want to start tabling on our campus farmers market selling crochet items like tops, totes, beanies, keychains etc. One of my goals is to create a fashion brand using the medium of crochet / textiles that eventually can be a shop. This website was a step towards that and a devotion of my love to crochet.

      Crochet College Essay :
      </h2>
      <p>
My support system consists of two items: my crochet hook and yarn. I introduced myself to crochet when I was in middle school. What middle schooler would want to learn how to crochet like a grandma? I did. It was the perfect pastime to learn. Growing up with no siblings, and a single mother who constantly worked left a lot of space for me to be alone. Crocheting kept me occupied for many hours. As soon as I got home from school I would grab my hook and yarn, and start watching tutorials to teach myself stitches. At the time I was unaware that the thousands of stitches I made would become a profound influence on my life. 

	My transition to high school mixed with added responsibilities at home made me stray away from crocheting. However as the lockdown began, I noticed my old baskets of yarn and bundles of hooks calling my name. My world of crochet was broadened during quarantine when I had the time to explore the different ways you can make crocheting your own. From TikTok to Instagram, I came across a new online community of creatives that were exploring different art forms using crochet as the medium. With new inspiration, I started to take on the challenge of testing new patterns and graduated from imperfect stitches to “perfect” machine made projects. 

As I spent more quality time crocheting, I started to realize that this old hobby of mine was becoming both a coping mechanism and a unique form of self-expression. It led me to understand that life is just like crocheting; it is a process that forces you to look beyond the simple ball of yarn in order to create something new. It requires you to keep an open mind, and a willingness to be challenged until you reach your final goal. During remote classes, I was often crocheting to help keep my hands busy while my mind focused. My moving hook quickly became a conversation starter with my peers as they were curious to learn more about my unusual skill. I always answered with great pride that I am self-taught and of the impact it has had on my life. I spoke about crochet the same way I would about a dear friend, with deep love and admiration. 
 
By November 2020, I gained the reputation of the girl who always crochets which ignited the attraction of my newly founded crochet club. After hearing my peers struggle with the isolation of quarantine, I wanted to support them the way I found support through crochet. I began my club that not only taught crochet as a fun, new hobby, but more importantly taught how crochet can be used to help them cope with their struggling mental health. As the club gained a large mix of beginner and intermediate members, we were able to find unity with a hook in one hand and a strand of yarn in the other, ready to take on whatever challenge came our way. We began to teach one another different skills, and found camaraderie and passion in this unique art form. The art form that keeps us connected soulfully regardless of our hardships in life.

Since becoming the founder of this fun and de-stressing club, I learned that I am passionate about mental health, teaching, and art. Now through the accumulation of all my experiences I know that I want to pursue a career that allows me to educate others through art therapy. I want to help teenagers understand that art can help them work through life challenges. Teaching them to be aware of the control they have over life and the potential that lies within them. Reflecting on how helpful my ball of yarn and bundle of hooks have been, I know I can always count on crocheting to be my peaceful pastime in life and what I can control.
