        What is Crochet & how does it differ from Knitting?
      </h2>
      <p>
Crochet is a process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn. The name is derived from the French term crochet, meaning 'hook'. Your main tool in crochet is a hook whereas knitting you use two needles. Also an important difference to note is that crochet can NOT be machine replicated, it can only be hand done. Whereas with knitting there's machinery that can replicate the knitting stitch these machines are typically factory use.

      How to start crocheting :
      </h2>
      <p>
Getting into crochet is a low cost hobby since it only requires a hook & yarn. You can purchase them from your local craft store (Micheals & Joann) or even a starter kit from amazon. The total should be no more than $20 to begin with. It's more of a time commitment hobby that requires patience and trail/error. Your bestie throughout your crochet journey will be Youtube. It's full of great beginner tutorials on the basic stitches and great patterns to follow along. Sometimes it's also better to ask someone that knows how to crochet for guidance in case the videos don't click right away. You can use my blog as a jumpstart underneath the “Crochet Guide” tab.

        How is crochet sustainable?
      </h2>
      <p>
Crochet fits into the category of slow fashion compared to fast fashion meaning that an crochet project is a forever lasting piece that won't ever go out of style and its materials can be reused. Compared to fast fashion which is to blame for the fashion industry being the second largest polluter in the world just after the oil industry. Also crochet can NOT be machine replicated meaning it's always handmade giving crochet an high value level that many refuse to believe. If it comes to a point where a project no longer needs to exist you can undo the piece and reuse the yarn and create a new piece. Also you can create sustainable yarn through recycled materials like plastic bags you can cut into strips and/or even crochet with sustainable material like cotton, bamboo, etc.
